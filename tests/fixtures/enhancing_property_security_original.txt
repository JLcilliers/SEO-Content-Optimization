Enhancing Property Security with External Cameras

External Cameras for Enhanced Property Security: A Guide to Your Options

When it comes to securing any property, having the right camera system in place is essential. When complex camera, surveillance, and video setups are not necessary for a property, the use of simpler external cameras integrated with an access control or visitor management solution (like CellGate's Entría and/or Watchman lines) can provide the right layer of extra security. Such external cameras utilized with these solutions allow you to monitor key entry points, capture video footage of visitors, and increase the safety of your property.

External cameras combined with access control or visitor management systems serve as valuable tools for property security. They not only provide real-time monitoring but also can store video footage for review in case of suspicious activity. Some of the key benefits of such external cameras include:

Visitor Identification: Record and/or review still photos of anyone entering or leaving your property and/or at key internal entry points.

License Plate Recognition: Capture vehicle and license plate details at vehicle gates.

Customizable Security: Choose the right camera to suit your property's layout and security needs based on distance and level of detail required at each location.

Choosing the right external cameras can also greatly enhance the effectiveness of your access control and visitor management systems, giving you added peace of mind. When property users and visitors know a camera(s) is in place, it reduces the likelihood of nefarious activity.
